# Welcome to Figura!
(Note - docs are WIP, more will appear here over time)

The current documentation is here to serve as a basic introduction to avatar creation using Figura. If you're a complete beginner, we suggest you head over to the [Mod Setup](guides/mod_setup.md) page, where you'll be walked through installing the mod and making a few basic avatars!

If you're a more technically-minded player who wants to see all the Lua APIs available, check out [FIGS!!](https://applejuiceyy.github.io/figs/) by applejuice.

If you're coming in from previous versions of the mod, 0.0.x, you might not be surprised to learn that a lot has changed. There's a lot to relearn, so it's probably still a good idea for you to read the beginner starter guide through just to make sure you're all caught up.

No matter your current experience level with the mod, we recommend you join our Discord! It's where the community gathers to hang out, share avatars, and help others with their creations. Look for the Help channels when you get there and you're likely to find people willing to lend you a hand with whatever you're looking for!
