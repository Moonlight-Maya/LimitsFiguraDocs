Welcome to the Figura Beginner's Guide! In this chain of pages, you'll be walked through the basic steps of creating some simple avatars, starting as just basic models and textures, and eventually moving into scripting.

## Required Software
First things first, let's get your tools. For this tutorial, you'll want to have the following software ready:

- Minecraft (obviously)
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) (or [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/en/install/)) Loader installed in a Minecraft instance
- Download the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (or the [Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl/versions), if using Quilt), as well as [Figura].
- [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) is the software we use for editing and saving models for use in avatars. There's a [web version](https://web.blockbench.net/), or you can use the [standalone program](https://www.blockbench.net/downloads).
- Some kind of text editor. It's recommended to use one intended for programming purposes. One program commonly used is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), because some Figura users have created helpful plugins to use with it for autocomplete and other neat things.

And that should be it! Once you have all of these things ready, you're all set to move on to the next step.

## Verifying Your Installation
Now it's time to open Minecraft and make sure Figura is installed correctly. To see if the mod is installed, enter a world and hit escape. You should see a small icon to the right of the menu. Click it to enter the Wardrobe screen.

## The Wardrobe Screen
The Wardrobe screen is the place where you can see all your avatars, and change which one you have equipped.

In the center of the screen is a preview for showing your currently equipped avatar. The right sidebar offers a bit of information about your currently selected avatar, and the left side is a view of all your avatars available to equip.

This view looks in your avatar folder and scans for avatars. This folder is where we're going to create our avatars. By default, your avatar folder will be located at `.minecraft/figura/avatars`. You can quickly jump there by hitting the folder icon in the top right of the avatar list, next to the search bar. Once you're in your avatars folder, it's finally time to start creating!
